Alright, everyone says this
Everyone says that, bruh
People say I gotta be different
But I'm just myself oh my, oh my
I got another hottie in my DMs
Every minute givin' me hell
Is it 'cause I'm fly? Is my life a motion
Picture? I'm feeling cinematic
And I don't care if I do not
Own a Rollie or Patek, my, oh my
(My, oh my, my, oh my) yeah
Roundhouse kick, I kick like Kato (Woo)
Elastic go 'round my payroll
Your girlfriend look like potato (O oh)
My necklace causes albedo
I'm flashy, can you catch me?
Fifty on a pink Porsche, two baddies
In the backseat horny, true story
Had to kick 'em out, sorry, hah, my, oh my
Yeah, I don't care what flavor
At least it be some cheese (Yup)
Have you seen how this baby walk? Bitch
He got steez (Woo)
And these girls use me so
I flick 'em like flea (Bam)
And I did it with ease
Said you wanna cut keys?
Huh, alright, I'ma fly to the UK
To eat marmite off a fine lady's booby
(bbno$)
I'm too polite, girl, may I see the booty?
I love my life, huh, my, oh my
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt)
People say I gotta be different
But I'm just myself oh my, oh my
I got another hottie in my DMs
Every minute givin' me hell
Is it 'cause I'm fly? Is my life a motion
Picture? I'm feeling cinematic
And I don't care if I do not
Own a Rollie or Patek, my, oh my
Lately, she used me
I saw that she's a problem
So I dunked on that bitch
She ain't nothin' but a goblin
Need an F for respect in
The chat for the fallen (F)
Nah, wanna use commas 'til they common
Life feels like I won the lottery
And your lady says she wanna give me sodomy
(Uh) only one problem, what it's costin' me?
And my mama say she proud that I own property
My, oh my, I got my bags up
Wait 'til you hear my song check up
She's your ex, I think she's next up
She's just in it for the Tesla
Alright, I'ma fly to the UK
To eat marmite off a fine lady's booby
I'm too polite, girl, may I see the booty?
I love my life, huh, my, oh my
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt)

My, oh my, yeah oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my my name is bbno$
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Oh, we're hittin' them with the fade-out
Alright
